Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability in insecure.js allows any user to update another user's role without authentication or authorization, risking privilege escalation. The secure.js version addresses this by implementing session-based authentication, restricting role updates to administrators only. 

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
- Input validation, logging, and rate limiting can further enhance protection against such attacks.
